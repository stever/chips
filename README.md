# chips

A toolbox of 8-bit chip-emulators, helper code and complete embeddable 
system emulators in dependency-free C headers (a subset of C99 that
compiles on gcc, clang and cl.exe).

Tests and example code is in a separate repo: https://github.com/floooh/chips-test

The example emulators, compiled to WebAssembly: https://floooh.github.io/tiny8bit/

For schematics, manuals and research material, see: https://github.com/floooh/emu-info

## WebAssembly support

@sehugg added WASM support for [8bitworkshop](https://8bitworkshop.com/).
You'll need to install [EMSDK](https://github.com/emscripten-core/emsdk)
first. Then type `make`.

## System Emulators

The directory ```systems``` contains a number of header-only 8-bit
computer emulators which can be embedded into applications that
provide keyboard input, and render the emulator's generated
video- and audio-output.

Note that accuracy of the system emulators varies quite a lot,
and is mainly defined by what games, demos and tests have been
used for testing and improving the emulation.

The following system emulators are provided:

### KC85/2, /3 and /4

An East German Z80-based computer with 320x256 color graphics, beeper
sound a powerful expansion slot system and (for its time) innovative
operating system. The KC85/2 family was designed and built
by VEB Mikroelektronik MÃ¼hlhausen between 1984 and 1989.

### Z9001 (aka KC85/1), KC87

Another East German 8-bitter created by Robotron Dresden.
This was a more conventional, less innovative design compared 
to the KC85/2, both in hardware and software. The Z9001 family
only had 40x20 ASCII pseudo-graphics display with optional
color support.

### Z1013

This was the most simple and cheapest Z80-based computer built
in Eastern Germany that still resembled a 'proper' computer which
could be attached to a TV. It was also the only Eastern German computer
that was available as assemble-youself-kit for the general public.

### ZX Spectrum 48k and 128

The Sinclair ZX Spectrum is supported as the original 48k model and
the improved 128 model with a proper sound chip (the AY-3-8912, which was 
also used in the Amstrad CPC).

## Chip Emulators

### Z80 CPU (chips/z80.h)

The Zilog Z80 CPU.

- tick-callback with CPU-pin bitmask, called with machine-cycle or single-tick granularity
- fast switch-case instruction decoder generated via python script
- up to 7 wait states can be injected per machine cycle by setting WAIT pins in 
  the CPU tick callback
- all undocumented instructions supported
- internal WZ register and undocumented XF and YF flags supported
- support for interrupt-priority handling (daisy chain) with help from the tick callback
- runs the ZEXDOC and ZEXALL tests
- runs the CPU test of the FUSE ZX Spectrum emulator, with the following exceptions:
  - the state of the XF/YF undocumented flags is ignored for indirect BIT
  test instructions, FUSE doesn't agree here with ZEXALL and I think ZEXALL
  is right (the state of the XF/YF flags depends on the current state of the
  internal WZ register)
  - FUSE assumes that the PC after a HALT instruction has been incremented,
  while the chips Z80 emulator doesn't incrmenent the PC, this shouldn't make
  any difference though
- properly handles sequences of DD/FD prefix bytes
- flexible trap callback for hooking in debuggers and "native code" handlers
- NOT IMPLEMENTED/TODO:
    - interrupt mode 0
    - refresh cycle in second half of opcode fetch machine cycle
    - bus request/acknowledge (BUSRQ/BUSAK pins)

### Z80 PIO (chips/z80pio.h)

The Zilog Z80 Parallel Input/Output controller.

- programmed via Z80-compatible chip-pin bitmask
- two callbacks for passive port A/B input/output
- write-function for active port A/B input (may trigger interrupt)
- can act as interrupt controller in a Z80 interrupt-daisy-chain
- NOT IMPLEMENTED:
    - bidirectional mode

### Z80 CTC (chips/z80ctc.h)

The Zilog Z80 Counter/Timer Channels.

- programmed via Z80-compatible chip-pin bitmask
- emulates the CLK/TRG and ZC/TO input/output pins
- can act as interrupt controller in a Z80 interrupt-daisy-chain

### MOS 6502 CPU (chips/m6502.h)

The MOS Technology 6502 CPU.

- single tick-callback with CPU-pin bitmask, called with tick-granularity
- fast switch-case instruction decoder generated via python script
- emulates all(?) quirks (like redundant and 'junk' read/write cycles, variable cycle counts in some addressing modes, page boundary wrap-around in indirect jump, etc...), mostly verified via visual6502.org
- emulates the known and useful 'documented-undocumented' opcodes (like LAX, SAX, DCP, ...)
- decimal mode implemented, can be disabled
- same powerful trap callback as the Z80 emulator
- test coverage:
    - **NESTEST**: completely working (this runs through all documented, and most 'common'
      undocumented instructions but doesn't test decimal mode)
    - **Wolfgang Lorenz C64 Test Suite**: all CPU opcode tests working, including
      the unintended and unstable instructions, instruction timings, branchwrap etc.
      Only two known issues remaining: the **irq** and **nmi** tests (also see
      the C64 notes in https://github.com/floooh/chips/blob/master/systems/README.md)

### AY-3-8910 (chips/ay38910.h)

The General Instrument AY-3-8910 sound generator chip and its low-cost variants
AY-3-8912 and AY-3-8913 (the 3 variants only differ in the number of provided
I/O ports, the 8910 has 2 ports, the 8912 has 1, and the 8913 has none.

- programmable via chip-pin bitmask
- separate tick function called from CPU tick callback, returns true when a new audio sample is ready

### MC6845 (chips/mc6845.h)

Motorola 6845 video address generator and variants.

- programmable via chip-pin bitmask
- tick function which generates hsync, vsync, display-enable, 13-bit 
  memory-address and 5-bit row-address, returned as pin-mask
- NOT IMPLEMENTED/TODO:
    - interlace mode
    - the cursor pin
    - the light-pen functionality
- NOTE: emulation quality is "ok" for most Amstrad graphics demos, but more
improvements are needed

### MC6847 (chips/mc6847.h)

Motorola 6847 video display generator.

- programmable via chip-pin bitmask
- tick function which directly generates a RGBA8 framebuffer
- memory-fetch callback called from the tick function, this returns
  a complete pin-mask and can be used to set the mode-select input pins
  (this is used in the Acorn Atom for instance, which directly connects
  data bus pins to MC6847 mode-select pins)

### i8255 PPI (chips/i8255.h)

Intel 8255 Programmable Peripheral Interface

- programmable via chip-pin mask
- NOT IMPLEMENTED / TODO:

    - Mode 2 (bi-directional bus)
    - interrupt generation

### MOS 6522 VIA (chips/m6522.h)

MOS Technology 6522 Versatile Interface Adapter.

Currently this just contains the minimal required functionality to make
some games on the Acorn Atom work (basically just timers, and even those
or likely not correct).

MOS Technology 6569 Video Interface Chip VIC-II (FIXME: needs more info)

### MOS 6581 SID (chips/m6581.h)

The C64 sound chip (FIXME: needs more info)

### AM40010 Amstrad CPC Gate Array Emulation (chips/am40010.h)

This emulated the Amstrad CPC gate array chip, and also integrates the PAL
chip for bankswitching in the 6128. 

### UPD765 Floppy Disc Controller (chips/upd765.h)

This is a basic emulation of the UPD765 floppy controller. Currently only
features required by the Amstrad CPC are implemented.

## Helper Code

### Memory (chips/mem.h)

Helper code for keyboard matrix typically found in 8-bit home computers.

- map host system key- or ASCII-codes to keyboard matrix locations
- up to 12x12 matrix size
- up to 4 configurable modifier keys (for shift keys)
- internal pressed-key-buffer for simultaneously pressed host system keys
- configurable 'sticky count' to lengthen short host-system key presses to
give the emulated system enough time to scan the keyboard matrix state

### Sound Beeper (chips/beeper.h)

A square-wave beeper found in many simple home computers.

- toggle beeper state on/off from CPU tick callback
- tick function returns true when new audio-sample is ready

### Clock (chips/clk.h)

Helper function to convert a clock frequency in Hz to a number of ticks,
and to keep track of the 'left over' ticks from one frame to the next.

### Floppy Disc Drive (chips/fdd.h)

A basic floppy disc drive emulator, currently only basic functionality
as needed by the Amstrad CPC emulation.

### Amstrad CPC Disk Image Loader (chips/fdd_cpc.h)

This is an extension-header for fdd.h which adds support to read
an Amstrad CPC .DSK disk image file and "insert" it into the Floppy Disc Drive
(fdd.h).
